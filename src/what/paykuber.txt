**Live Data Features – Tech Implementation Notes**

To enable live crypto/stock/forex data:
- Use APIs from:
  - [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) / [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) (for crypto)
  - [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) / [Twelve Data](https://twelvedata.com/) (for stocks/forex)
  - [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/widget/) widgets for live charts
- Use **WebSocket APIs** for real-time updates (vs REST APIs for periodic polling)
- Caching + rate limit handling to optimize load times

**Aapko kya karna chahiye?**
✔️ Ye structure web developer ko dena
✔️ API selection aur integration plan banana
✔️ UI/UX designer se chart layout aur live data placement ka mockup banana

Agar chahen to main aapko:
- **JSON sitemap**
- **Wireframe images**
- **API integration plan (with sample code)**
bhi de sakta hoon.

Batayein agar chahiye toh.
